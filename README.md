# Tasks.rb

Little personal project to get the hang out of three tools made by [soveran](https://github.com/soveran): [Cuba](https://github.com/soveran/cuba) microframework for web development, [Mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote) template engine and [Ohm](https://github.com/soveran/ohm) for Redis support and persistence.

## Usage

It's simple so far. You fire up the server in the root of the project and access to it through your favourite browser. You'll be presented with the current task list with done and undone tasks.

### Features

- [X] List current task list
- [X] Add a task to the current task list
- [X] Delete task from current task list
- [X] Differentiate done and undone tasks
- [ ] Have more than one task list
- [ ] Multiple users and login support

### Future work

Check the issue tracker of this repository to see what I'm up to currently.

### Special thanks

To [Tonchis](https://github.com/tonchis), for all the support and patience with my, sometimes dumb, questions when I intend to steal all of his knowledge.
