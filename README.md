# Tasks.rb

Little personal project to get the hang out of two tools made by [soveran]("https://github.com/soveran"): [Cuba]("https://github.com/soveran/cuba") microframework for web development and [Mote]("https://github.com/soveran/mote") template engine.

## Usage

It's simple so far. You fire up the server in the root of the project and access to it through your favourite browser. You'll be presented with the current task list with done and undone tasks.

### Features

- [x] List current task list
- [ ] add a task to the current task list (with a simple redirect it just reloads the page. Have to add a little persistence, maybe?)
- [ ] delete task from current task list
- [ ] Differentiate done and undone tasks

### Special thanks

To [Tonchis]("https://github.com/tonchis"), for all the support and patience with my, sometimes dumb, questions when I intend to steal all of his knowledge.
